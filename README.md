Originally aspiring to become a life-saving doctor, I "stumbled" into the IT industry instead. Since graduating, I have been working in various roles related to the internet. These include enterprise IT, gaming, blockchain, and the Internet of Things. Throughout the process of accumulating experience, I have developed a fondness for the internet industry and have become skilled at dissecting requirements by combining a full-stack mindset with practical resources.

In my free time, I enjoy browsing the internet to appreciate well-designed websites and applications. I keep an eye on emerging technologies to broaden my thinking and motivate myself to continue learning. I collect materials and study notes that I find interesting, expanding my skills and mindset, always maintaining a learning attitude.

### Personal media

By writing articles, I summarize and discover the shortcomings of technology, constantly motivating myself to explore new opportunities and future directions.
